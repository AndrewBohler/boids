# boids
boid simulation using python and pygame

requires numpy and pygame

If you have Anaconda installed you can run by doing the following:

```
conda create -n boids python=3.8 numpy
conda activate boids
pip install pygame
git clone https://github.com/AndrewBohler/boids
cd boids

pygame is not hosted on Anaconda so you have to install it with pip
